This type of learning covers our engagement with content, regardless of form or format. We can all learn by exposure to information and our innate ability to link concepts and topics to existing information within our schema. This type of learning relies on presenting information in ways that learners can connect to the information they already know. Rather than learners being empty vessels that we fill up with ideas, this type of learning requires students to assimilate information and connect it with what they already know and understand. This often requires information to be presented in multi and mixed-modal forms to engage with learners' different modes of understanding.
