This type of learning comes through interaction and voicing different perspectives. The aim of discursive learning is for learners to feel comfortable in participating and sharing their perspectives. This can be challenging for those who perceive their capacity as novices, particularly if they are active in an expert space. The richness of discursive learning is unlocking different perspectives and experiences. Discussion allows the perspectives and paradigms to be moved and changed, pushing learners to reconsider their positions and understanding. The variations and differences that can be presented within discursive learning provide increased possibilities for learners to connect information and concepts to their schema in unique ways.
