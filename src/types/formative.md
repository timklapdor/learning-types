This type of learning requires the learner to attempt to complete a specific activity. While often associated with quizzes and knowledge checks, this type of learning is essential to skills-based learning and areas that require an understanding of tactile, kinaesthetic and spatial concepts. There are many instances where it is impossible to describe an action or the act of doing it, regardless of the fidelity of the medium. Getting learners to act and do the task is the only way they can experience the feeling of that event and develop an understanding that connects with their schema in a multi-sensory way.
