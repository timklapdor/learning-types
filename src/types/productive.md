This type of learning involves learners working through the process of creating an artefact. The artefact can take any shape or form and be developed in any media - what matters is the process. Working through a specific set of steps or workflow or by challenging those conventions, learners are provided with an opportunity to work through more complex and complicated work. These tasks tend to bring together analysis, planning, synthesis, innovation, problem-solving and communication skills. The increased complexity involved in productive learning makes it effective for assessment and as evidence of student learning and progress.
