This type of learning involves socialised actions and behaviours that enable opportunities to learn together, from each other and through shared experiences. This type of learning is framed as group work or collaboration, but Social Learning is much more expansive and involves all kinds of interactions, aims and points of contact. These activities can take the form of cooperative work, sharing resources, openness and acceptance, and informal social engagements that aren't explicitly for learning a specific concept but to build connections between others and develop a sense of shared ownership of the learning.
