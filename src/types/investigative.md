This type of learning engages learners in searching and discovering information. Rather than presenting students with information, Investigative Learning requires learners to find it independently and develop their research, understanding and comprehension skills. This type of learning can be strongly facilitated and activity-driven. Learners can be engaged not just in seeking out the source of information but also in interpreting the information provided and their ability to extract understanding from what is presented.
